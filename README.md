🟢 Create a luxurious landing page using Flutter Web for a real estate company called "الطخيم العالمية للعقارات".

🎨 UI & Style Requirements:

Use golden gradient colors (gold + black/white/grey contrast) to give a premium luxury feeling.

Add animated background shapes (like soft geometric waves, particles, or abstract real estate silhouettes moving slowly).

Typography must use elegant Arabic fonts (different heading font vs. body font) to enhance brand identity.

Company name in large gold lettering with a slogan underneath (e.g. "نحو مستقبل عقاري آمن").

Modern real estate themed icons or subtle illustrations (buildings, skyline, keys, houses) integrated into design.

📱 Functionality:

3 premium golden-glass effect buttons with WhatsApp icons + text.

Each button should have the text "تواصل مع مستشار العقارات" + (Agent Name/Role).

On click:

Show an in-site popup card (with golden glow) saying:

"جارٍ تحويلك إلى مستشارنا العقاري..."

After 1.5s, redirect to the respective WhatsApp chat links:

https://wa.me/966XXXXXXXXX

https://wa.me/966YYYYYYYYY

https://wa.me/966ZZZZZZZZZ

This makes Snapchat Ads accept it (avoids direct click-to-WhatsApp rejection).

⚡ Extra Sections:

Short company description about خدمات الشركة العقارية.

Showcase section (3 cards with icons like 🏠 فيلات – 🏢 أبراج – 🛋️ شقق).

Contact info (phone, email).

Footer with © حقوق الطبع محفوظة لشركة الطخيم العالمية للعقارات.

🚀 Output:

Full Flutter Web code with main.dart.

Include animations (e.g. AnimatedContainer, Lottie, or CustomPainter for moving real estate shapes).

Responsive design for both mobile and desktop.

The final look must feel high-end, real estate luxury website, not just a WhatsApp redirect page.
